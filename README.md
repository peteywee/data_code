# Firebase Orchestrator

> A reproducible, agent-driven orchestration platform built on **Firebase** + **Next.js App Router** + **pnpm workspaces**.  
> Not just a prototyper â€” a **system that builds systems**.

## ðŸš€ Vision

This project is a **factory for software**.  
Instead of building one app, weâ€™re building an orchestrator that can:

- Take vague goals â†’ break them into **structured layers**.  
- Route tasks to specialized **agents**.  
- Generate **typed contracts + production-grade code**.  
- Validate outputs with **lint + type-check sandbox**.  
- Deploy globally on **Firebase Hosting + Functions + Cloud Run**.  

The goal:  
**Move from idea â†’ production blueprint in hours, not months.**
